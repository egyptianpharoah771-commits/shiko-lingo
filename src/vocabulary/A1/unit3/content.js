  explanation: [
    "This unit focuses on common places you see in your city or neighborhood.",
    "These words help you talk about where you go and where things are.",
    "When you talk about places, you often use verbs like 'go to' or 'is'.",
    "For example: I go to school. The hospital is near my house.",
    "Words like 'near' and 'far' help you describe distance between places.",
    "Use 'near' when something is close, and 'far' when it is not close.",
    "In English, we usually say: The place is near something.",
    "Try to describe places around you, such as your house, your school, or the market."
