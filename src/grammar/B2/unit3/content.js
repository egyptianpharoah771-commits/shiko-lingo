  title: "Reported Speech (Statements, Questions & Commands)",
  explanation: `
At B2 level, reported speech is used to accurately report
what someone said, asked, or told another person to do.

The main focus is on adjusting language to fit the new context,
including verb tense, pronouns, and time or place expressions.
However, tense changes depend on meaning, not on rules alone.
  `,
  rules: [
    "Statements: said (that) + clause",
    "Questions: asked + if / whether / wh-word (statement word order)",
    "Commands and requests: told / asked + object + to-infinitive",
    "Backshifting usually happens when the reporting verb is in the past",
    "Will → Would, Can → Could, May → Might",
    "No backshifting if the fact is still true or timeless",
    "Time and place words may change: today → that day, here → there, now → then"
  ],
  examples: [
    "She said, 'I am tired.' → She said that she was tired.",
    "He asked, 'Where do you live?' → He asked where I lived.",
    "They asked, 'Are you coming?' → They asked if I was coming.",
    "The teacher said, 'Be quiet.' → The teacher told us to be quiet.",
    "She said, 'The earth is round.' → She said that the earth is round.",
    "He said, 'I can help you.' → He said that he could help me."
