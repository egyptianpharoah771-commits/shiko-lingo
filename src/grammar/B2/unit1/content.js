  title: "Passive Voice (All Tenses & Advanced Use)",
  explanation: `
At B2 level, the Passive Voice is used to control focus.
The emphasis is placed on the action, result, or process,
not on who performs the action.

It is commonly used when the doer is unknown, unimportant,
obvious from context, or deliberately omitted to sound formal or objective.
  `,
  rules: [
    "Basic structure: subject + be + past participle (V3)",
    "The tense is shown through the verb 'be'",
    "Passive forms exist in all main tenses, including perfect and continuous",
    "Use 'by' to mention the agent only if it adds important information",
    "Omitting the agent is common in formal and academic contexts",
    "Passive voice is often used to sound neutral, formal, or impersonal"
  ],
  examples: [
    "The letter is written every day. (present simple passive)",
    "The house was built in 1995. (past simple passive)",
    "The report has been completed. (present perfect passive)",
    "The meeting will be held tomorrow. (future passive)",
    "The experiment is being conducted carefully. (continuous passive)",
    "The decision was made by the committee. (agent included)"
