  title: "Conditionals (All Types & Mixed Conditionals)",
  explanation: `
At B2 level, conditionals are used to express more than simple cause and effect.
They help speakers talk about probability, imagination, regret,
and the consequences of different choices across time.

Mixed conditionals allow us to connect past actions
with present or future results.

  rules: [
    "Zero Conditional: if + present simple, present simple (general truths)",
    "First Conditional: if + present simple, will + base verb (real future result)",
    "Second Conditional: if + past simple, would + base verb (unreal present or future)",
    "Third Conditional: if + past perfect, would have + past participle (unreal past)",
    "Mixed Conditionals link different time frames (past to present, past to future)",
    "Use 'unless' as a stronger form of 'if ... not'"
  ],
  examples: [
    "If you heat ice, it melts. (general truth)",
    "If it rains, I will stay at home. (real future possibility)",
    "If I had more time, I would travel more. (unreal present)",
    "If she had studied harder, she would have passed the exam. (unreal past)",
    "If I had taken that job, I would be living abroad now. (past cause, present result)",
    "Unless you act quickly, the opportunity will be lost."
