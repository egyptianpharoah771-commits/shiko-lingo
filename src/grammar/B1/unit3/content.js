  title: "Future Forms: will vs going to",
  explanation: `
At B1 level, we use 'will' and 'going to' to talk about the future,
but the difference depends on intention and timing.

The key idea is whether the decision is made now
or was already planned before speaking.
  `,
  rules: [
    "Use 'will' for decisions made at the moment of speaking",
    "Use 'will' for promises, offers, and quick reactions",
    "Use 'going to' for plans decided before speaking",
    "Use 'going to' for predictions based on clear evidence"
  ],
  examples: [
    "I’m tired. I will go to bed now. (decision made now)",
    "Don’t worry, I’ll help you. (offer)",
    "She is going to start a new job next month. (planned decision)",
    "Look at those dark clouds! It’s going to rain. (clear evidence)",
    "We are going to visit our grandparents this weekend."
