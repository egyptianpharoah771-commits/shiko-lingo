  title: "Choosing Between Present Perfect and Past Simple",
  explanation: `
At B1 level, learners often know the two tenses,
but feel unsure which one to use in real situations.

This unit focuses on choosing the correct tense
based on whether the speaker is thinking about
a finished time or a general experience.
  `,
  rules: [
    "Use Present Perfect to talk about experiences without saying when",
    "Use Past Simple when the time is mentioned or clearly finished",
    "Time words like yesterday, last week, and in 2020 require Past Simple",
    "Words like ever, never, and before are often used with Present Perfect",
    "Always ask: Is the time important or finished?"
  ],
  examples: [
    "I have seen this movie before. (experience)",
    "I saw this movie last night. (finished time)",
    "She has never traveled abroad. (life experience)",
    "She traveled abroad in 2018. (specific time)",
    "Have you ever tried sushi?"
  ]
