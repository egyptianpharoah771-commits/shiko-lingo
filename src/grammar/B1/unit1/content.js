  title: "Present Perfect vs Past Simple",
  explanation: `
Both the Present Perfect and the Past Simple are used to talk about past actions,
but they show different ways of looking at time.

The Present Perfect looks at the past from the present moment.
The exact time is not important — what matters is the experience or result now.

The Past Simple looks at the past as finished and separate from the present.
The time is known, mentioned, or understood.
  `,
  rules: [
    "Present Perfect: have / has + past participle",
    "Use Present Perfect when the time is not mentioned or not important",
    "Past Simple: verb in past form (V2 or irregular)",
    "Use Past Simple when the action happened at a finished time",
    "Finished time expressions: yesterday, last week, last year, in 2020"
  ],
  examples: [
    "I have visited Paris. (experience, no time mentioned)",
    "I visited Paris in 2019. (finished time)",
    "She has lost her keys. (the result is important now)",
    "She lost her keys yesterday. (finished past action)",
    "Have you ever seen this movie?"
  ]
