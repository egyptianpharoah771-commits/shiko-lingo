  title: "Nuance in Meaning and Expression",
  explanation: `
At C1 level, learners move beyond grammatical correctness
to understanding subtle differences in meaning and intention.

This unit focuses on how small changes in wording can affect
tone, emphasis, certainty, and implication, even when sentences
are grammatically correct.
  `,
  rules: [
    "Different word choices can signal varying levels of certainty or caution",
    "Adding modal or reporting structures can distance the speaker from a claim",
    "Certain adverbs subtly change emphasis or implication",
    "Formality often depends on lexical choice rather than structure",
    "Writers may soften or strengthen statements without changing the core meaning",
    "Grammatically correct sentences can still differ significantly in nuance"
  ],
  examples: [
    "She will complete the project by Friday.",
    "She is expected to complete the project by Friday.",
    "The results show a big difference between the groups.",
    "The results indicate a significant difference between the groups.",
    "He resolved the issue.",
    "He managed to resolve the issue.",
    "The proposal is interesting.",
    "The proposal is interesting, but somewhat unclear."
