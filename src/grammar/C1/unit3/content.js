  title: "Advanced Linking & Cohesion",
  explanation: `
At C1 level, effective communication depends on how ideas are connected
across sentences and entire paragraphs.

Advanced linking expressions help speakers and writers organize arguments,
highlight relationships between ideas, and produce clear, formal,
and persuasive discourse.
  `,
  rules: [
    "Use contrast linkers to introduce opposing ideas (however, nevertheless, whereas)",
    "Use result and consequence linkers to show outcomes (therefore, consequently, as a result)",
    "Use addition linkers to expand or reinforce ideas (moreover, furthermore, in addition)",
    "Use concession linkers to introduce unexpected contrast (although, despite, in spite of)",
    "Use discourse markers to guide the reader or listener (on the one hand, in contrast, for this reason)",
    "Avoid overusing basic linkers such as 'and', 'but', or 'so' in formal or academic contexts"
  ],
  examples: [
    "The plan failed; however, valuable lessons were learned.",
    "She was exhausted; nevertheless, she continued working under pressure.",
    "The initial cost was high; therefore, the proposal was rejected.",
    "Moreover, the results exceeded expectations and confirmed earlier predictions.",
    "Despite the difficulties encountered, the team succeeded in completing the project.",
