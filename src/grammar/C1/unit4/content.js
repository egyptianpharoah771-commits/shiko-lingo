  title: "Nuance, Tone & Formality",
  explanation: `
At C1 level, speakers and writers adjust tone, style, and word choice
deliberately according to context, audience, and purpose.

Mastering nuance and formality helps communication sound polite,
professional, and precise without losing clarity or confidence.
  `,
  rules: [
    "Formal language often avoids contractions (do not, cannot)",
    "Word choice directly affects tone (ask → request → inquire)",
    "Indirect language usually sounds more polite and diplomatic",
    "Hedging expressions soften statements (seems, appears, tends to)",
    "Formal writing prefers neutral or impersonal structures",
    "Tone should always match the context (email, report, presentation, discussion)"
  ],
  examples: [
    "Could you possibly assist me with this matter? (formal request)",
    "It appears that the results were influenced by external factors. (hedging)",
    "I would appreciate your feedback on this issue at your convenience.",
    "The proposal seems to require further discussion before approval.",
    "We regret to inform you that your request has been declined.",
    "I disagree with this approach, although I understand its advantages. (polite disagreement)"
  ]
