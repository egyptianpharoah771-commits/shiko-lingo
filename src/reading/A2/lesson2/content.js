Sara lives in a big city with her family. The city is always busy, with many people, cars, and buses everywhere. In the morning, the streets are crowded because people go to work and students go to school.

Sara uses public transportation to move around the city. Sometimes it is fast, but at other times it is slow because of traffic. Although city life can be noisy and stressful, Sara likes it because everything she needs is close to her home.

In the evening, Sara enjoys walking in the streets or sitting in a café with her friends. Living in the city is not always easy, but it gives her many opportunities to learn, work, and meet new people.
