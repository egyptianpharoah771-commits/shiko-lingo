Ahmed works in a small company in Cairo. He wakes up early every day and leaves his house at 7:30 a.m. Because the traffic is heavy, it takes him almost one hour to arrive at work.

When Ahmed arrives at the office, he first checks his emails and makes a plan for the day. He works with his team on different projects and sometimes joins online meetings. Although his job is busy, he enjoys learning new skills and solving problems.

During his lunch break, Ahmed eats with his colleagues and talks about work and daily life. After he finishes work at 5:00 p.m., he goes home feeling tired but satisfied. In the evening, he usually watches a movie or reads a book to relax.
