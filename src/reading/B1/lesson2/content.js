Many people today struggle to find a balance between work and personal life.
Nour works as a graphic designer, and she loves her job, but sometimes it takes too much of her time.

She often stays late at work to finish projects and meet deadlines. At first, Nour felt proud of being productive, but after some time, she noticed that she was always tired and had less time for her family and friends. She stopped exercising and felt stressed most of the time.

One day, Nour decided to change her routine. She started planning her work better and setting clear limits. She left work on time and used her evenings to relax or spend time with people she loves. Although she still works hard, she now feels healthier and happier.

Nour learned that success is not only about working more hours, but also about taking care of yourself.
