Helping others can make a big difference, not only for them but also for ourselves. Ali learned this when he started volunteering in his community.

Every weekend, Ali helps organize activities for children. At first, he thought it would be tiring, but he soon realized how rewarding it was. Seeing smiles on people’s faces made him feel useful and proud.

Ali believes that small actions can have a strong impact. Helping others taught him empathy, responsibility, and the value of teamwork.
