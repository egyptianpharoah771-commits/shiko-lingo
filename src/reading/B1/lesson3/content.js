Everyone makes mistakes, but not everyone learns from them. Hassan learned this lesson through his own experience.

Hassan once made an important mistake at work by sending the wrong information to a client. At first, he felt embarrassed and afraid of losing his job. Instead of blaming others, he admitted his mistake and apologized.

His manager appreciated his honesty and helped him fix the problem. From that day on, Hassan became more careful and confident. He realized that mistakes can be valuable if we use them as learning opportunities.

This experience taught Hassan that failure is not the end, but a step toward improvement.
