Technology has become a big part of our daily lives. People use smartphones, computers, and the internet for work, study, and entertainment.

Salma believes that technology makes life easier, especially for communication and learning. However, she also notices that people sometimes spend too much time on their devices. This can reduce face-to-face communication and negatively affect relationships.

Salma tries to use technology wisely. She limits her screen time and focuses on using technology as a tool, not a habit. She believes that balance is the key to enjoying the benefits without the negative effects.
